# Our app

Our app allows users to help each other in this difficult time of COVID-19. It creates an online community where requests for help are matched with others who may be able to fulfill it. More than just a means however, this app appeals to our inner selflessness and provides light in someone's day despite the circumstances of the world.

# The mechanics

Our recommendation algorithm groups users who live in a similar area and who's requests match in type. The data is constantly updated via our database to deliver personalized information for each user. The feed is curated based on users in a similar locale, so one need not wait to be matched up with someone in order to do a good deed. The requests contain the contact information from the user who made it and additional information relating to the request, allowing others to easily reach and discuss next steps to fulfill that need. The computation is wrapped nicely in an easy-to-use UI with a refreshing layout and intuitive design.
